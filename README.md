# ClipSalt
Add a little spice to your clipboard.

This is for any data professional who is constantly writing sql and minipulating tables and data files.
Many feature immulate "SQL Complete" by devart, however that is and expensive package so I have imitated a handful of the most useful utilities and added additional ones.

Notes:All comparison logic assumes cases insensitivity

Setup:

-Download the clipsalt executable files and extract it anywhere on your local drive.

-Right click your taskbar and select "Toolbars" and then "New Toolbar"

-Point to you ClipSalt executables extracted in step 1
